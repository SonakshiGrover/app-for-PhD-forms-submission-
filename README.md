# app-for-PhD-forms-submission-

This is a an app (coded in JAVA) which can be used by any Institute to have a set of forms to be filled for PhD Admissions. Javafx has been used to design the GUI window. As of now, the design and functionality are
applicable only on the local machine i.e we have not dealt with remote(web-based) form
applications as of now.

Corresponding to every application, we maintained all the data (obtained from
textfields, dropdowns, radiobuttons etc.) along with the timestamp of form submission in a file.

On clicking submit button,
 You must check if all mandatory fields are filled. If so, then proceed, else prompt will appear instructing to fill the
missing fields.
 Once proceeded, the form would generate a unique enrollment id and export all data to a
file.

The form also provides an option to upload the CV and SOP.
